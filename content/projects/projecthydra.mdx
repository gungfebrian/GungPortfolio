# Supercomputing in the Browser

Cloud computing is expensive. But we all have powerful GPUs sitting idle in our laptops and phones. **Hydra** is a proof-of-concept for a decentralized "Volunteer Computing" grid.

By visiting a URL, a device becomes a "Node." The Host machine splits a complex matrix multiplication or rendering task into chunks, distributes them via **WebSockets** to all connected Nodes, and aggregates the results—turning a classroom of Chromebooks into a supercomputer.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute Core** | WebGPU (WGSL) | Hardware-accelerated parallel processing |
| **Networking** | Socket.io | Real-time task distribution & synchronization |
| **Frontend** | React + Three.js | Visualizing active nodes and task progress |
| **Backend** | Node.js / Redis | Orchestrating connections and state |

## ⚙️ The Engineering Challenge

1.  **Latency vs. Compute:** Sending data over the network takes time. I must calculate the "Cost of Transfer" vs. "Cost of Compute" to ensure distributing the task is actually faster than running it locally.
2.  **Fault Tolerance:** If a phone disconnects mid-calculation, the system must detect the dropout and re-assign that chunk of work to another node immediately.
3.  **Shader Programming:** Writing raw **WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language)** to perform general-purpose calculations (GPGPU) on the graphics card.

# The Mission

Plastic pollution is a crisis. Manual cleanup is slow. **Green Rover** is the solution.

I engineered this robot, it is a fully autonomous agent capable of patrolling environments, identifying waste with good perception, and navigating complex terrain without intervention.

During operation, Green Rover performs **continuous on device inference**, detecting plastic waste in real time while navigating autonomously.  
Each detection includes **class labels and spatial positioning**, enabling stable tracking even under uneven lighting and cluttered backgrounds.

The core innovation of Green Rover is its **Hybrid Dual Controller System**, a "Brain and Muscle" architecture designed to overcome the hardware limitations of standard IoT devices.

### The Brain: Raspberry Pi 4
* **Role:** High Level Intelligence.
* **Function:** Runs the YOLOv8 Neural Network, processes voice commands, and hosts the web dashboard.
* **Why:** It delegates all physical exertion to the ESP32, ensuring the AI never stutters.

### The Muscle: ESP32
* **Role:** Real Time Reflexes.
* **Function:** Generates precise PWM signals for motors, controls the pan tilt servo, and reads ultrasonic sensors in microseconds.
* **Impact:** This split architecture boosted system performance by **300%**, jumping from 4.5 FPS to **14.5 FPS**.

## 🧠 AI Engineering with Roboflow

Data is the lifeblood of AI. I didn't just use a pre made model, I built a custom visual engine tailored for the Indonesian environment.

* **Custom Dataset:** I curated and labeled **950 images** using **Roboflow**, specifically targeting local plastic waste.
* **Specific Classes:** The model is trained to distinguish between generic plastic and specific local brands like **Aqua, Cleo, and Le Minerale** bottles.
* **Training:** Leveraging **YOLOv8 Nano**, I optimized the model for edge deployment, achieving a balance of speed and accuracy that allows for real-time tracking in dynamic lighting.

## Observed Performance Metrics

| Metric | Result |
|------|-------|
| Inference Speed | ~14.5 FPS (on-device) |
| Detection Range | ~2–2.5 meters (indoor testing) |
| Runtime Stability | Continuous operation without frame drops |
| Power Separation | Stable inference under motor load |

All measurements were observed during real-world testing rather than simulated environments.

## Challenges

Building a custom robot from scratch came with significant engineering challenges:

1.  **The Latency Bottleneck:** Initially, running both the AI and motor control on the Raspberry Pi caused the system to freeze. I solved this by decoupling the systems into the "Brain & Muscle" architecture.
2.  **Lighting Conditions:** The vision system struggled in dim indoor lighting. I had to fine tune the camera's ISO gain and implement a dynamic confidence threshold in the code to prevent false positives.
3.  **Sensor Interference:** The ultrasonic sensors would sometimes interfere with each other. I wrote a custom timing algorithm in C++ for the ESP32 to trigger them sequentially rather than simultaneously.

## My Role & Ownership

This project was **designed, built, and integrated end to end** by me, covering:

* Dataset collection and annotation
* YOLOv8 model training and optimization
* ESP32 firmware (motor control, sensor timing)
* Raspberry Pi AI pipeline and system orchestration
* Mechanical assembly and electronics integration

## Future Improvements

While the system is currently functional, I plan to push the boundaries further:

* **Add 2 DOF Hand:** I want to add a robotic hand so it can also pick up trash.
* **Adaptive Navigation:** Upgrading the obstacle avoidance logic from simple "stop and turn" to pathfinding algorithms like.
* **Battery Management:** Designing a custom PCB for power distribution to replace the bulky power bank setup.

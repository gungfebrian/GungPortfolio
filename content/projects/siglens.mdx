# Breaking the Silence

Video calls are a standard part of life, but they remain inaccessible to the mute and deaf community without human interpreters. **SignLens** bridges this gap using Edge AI.

Unlike server-based solutions that send video to the cloud (risking privacy and latency), SignLens runs a lightweight **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network entirely inside the user's browser. It tracks hand skeleton landmarks in real-time and translates dynamic gestures into spoken audio.

## 🧠 The Engineering Challenge

1.  **Sequence Modeling:** A static image isn't enough (e.g., "Hello" is a wave, not a pose). I trained a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze *temporal* sequences of hand positions over 30 frames.
2.  **Performance Optimization:** Running pose estimation + neural network inference + video rendering simultaneously is heavy. I utilize **Web Workers** to offload the AI processing, keeping the main thread free for UI rendering.
3.  **Data Collection:** I built a custom data-recording tool to capture diverse sign language samples, creating a robust dataset for training.

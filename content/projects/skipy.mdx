Overview

For this project, I wanted to explore the fundamentals of robotics and kinematics. I challenged myself to build not just the robot, but also an intuitive way for anyone to control it. The result is SKIPY, a 4 DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm that can be programmed through a simple local host web interface.

Tech Stack & Hardware

Microcontroller: ESP32

Actuators: 4x SG90 Servos

Power: 2x 20A 3.7v Batteries with XL 4006 Stepdown (5A)

Display: OLED 64x128 (acting as a "face" to make SKIPY feel alive)

Software: C++, Web Interface (HTML/CSS/JS hosted on ESP32)

How It Works

SKIPY features 4 servos: 3 to control the movement (Base, Shoulder, Elbow) and 1 for the Gripper. The integrated web controller allows users to control each servo individually.

The OLED screen acts as a face, giving the robot personality.

UI/UX Design

The core of this project was the user experience. I designed a web controller centered around a "teach and repeat" workflow.

Intuitive Workflow: The interface provides actions like "Record," "Add Point," and "Play."

Programming: A user can program the arm simply by moving it to a position using sliders and saving that point, creating a sequence step-by-step.

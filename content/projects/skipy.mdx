# The Mission

For this project, I wanted to explore the fundamentals of robotics and kinematics. I challenged myself to build not just the robot, but also an intuitive way for anyone to control it. The result is SKIPY, a 3 DOF Degrees of Freedom robotic arm that can be programmed through a simple local host web interface.

## Hardware Specs

I engineered the power delivery system to handle high current spikes from the servos, ensuring smooth operation without brownouts.

| Component | Specification | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microcontroller** | ESP32 | Web Server & Kinematics Engine |
| **Actuators** | 4x SG90 Servos | 3 DOF Movement + 1 Gripper |
| **Power Storage** | 2x 18650 Li-ion Batteries | High capacity power source |
| **Regulation** | XL4006 Step Down | Stable 5V output |
| **Stability** | 1000µF Capacitor | Smoothing voltage spikes |
| **Display** | OLED 64x128 | Status & Personality Interface |

## Engineering The Logic

SKIPY features a 3-DOF architecture driven by 4 servos: three control the spatial positioning (Base, Shoulder, Elbow) and one actuates the Gripper.

The OLED screen acts as a face, giving the robot personality while providing system status feedback.

### Teach and Repeat

The core of this project was the user experience. I designed a web controller centered around a "teach and repeat" workflow.

* **Intuitive Workflow:** The interface provides actions like Record, Add Point, and Play.
* **Programming:** A user can program the arm simply by moving it to a position using sliders and saving that point, creating a sequence step by step.

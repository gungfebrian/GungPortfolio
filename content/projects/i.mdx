# The Mission

In closed enclosures like acrylic boxes, heat often becomes trapped, causing temperatures to spike beyond safe limits. Simply adding a heater isn't enough; you need a dynamic system that can both generate and evacuate heat to maintain a delicate equilibrium.

I engineered this **Thermal Chamber** to solve the problem of thermal instability. My objective was to create a stable environment using a PTC heater and an exhaust fan controlled by a single intelligent loop, ensuring the environment remains within a precise "Dead Zone" suitable for incubation.

## The Intelligence: Hysteresis Control Logic

Instead of a simple ON/OFF thermostat that causes rapid, damaging relay switching (chattering), I implemented a **Hysteresis Algorithm**. This approach uses the system's history to prevent unnecessary oscillations and extend the lifespan of mechanical components.

### The Logic Flow:
* **Heating Phase:** If T Less Then 26.5°C, the PTC Heater activates and the Fan remains OFF.
* **The Dead Zone (Stability):** Between **26.5°C and 27.5°C**, the system enters a "Dead Zone" where all actuators are OFF to save energy.
* **Cooling Phase:** If T More than 27.5°C, the Fan activates to evacuate excess heat.

## Hardware & Architecture

The system utilizes an **ESP32** as the central brain, processing real-time sensor data while simultaneously hosting a web server for remote interaction.

| Component | Specification | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microcontroller** | ESP32 DevKit V1 | Main Processor & Wi-Fi Web Server |
| **Sensor** | DHT-11 | Temperature & Humidity Sensing |
| **Heating** | PTC Heater 12V | Thermal Generation |
| **Cooling** | Brushless DC Fan 12V | Heat Evacuation |
| **Power** | LM2596 Step-Down | Voltage Regulation (12V to 5V) |
| **Display** | LCD I2C 16x2 | Local Real-time Monitoring |

## 🌐 Real-Time IoT Dashboard

I developed a custom **Web Dashboard** hosted directly on the ESP32 (IP `192.168.4.1`). This provides an essential layer of control that conventional thermostats lack.

* **High Responsiveness:** Data updates with an average latency of **&lt;200ms**.
* **Manual Safety Override:** In emergency scenarios or sensor failures, I programmed the system so users can manually force the fan or heater ON/OFF via the web interface.
* **Redundancy:** If the network fails, the physical LCD provides an immediate local backup for data monitoring.

## Challenges & Engineering Evaluation

Professional engineering requires the courage to analyze failures. During the final demonstration, the exhaust fan failed to rotate despite the system status showing "ON".

**My Post-Mortem Investigation:**
1. **Mechanical Integrity:** The use of jumper wires on the relay output had low resistance to vibration. When the device was moved, the connection became loose.
2. **Contact Resistance:** I identified high contact resistance in the fuse holder, causing momentary power instability.
3. **The Solution:** For industrial-grade reliability, I concluded that moving from prototypes to **permanent terminal blocks and custom PCBs** is a non-negotiable requirement.

## Performance Results

Despite the mechanical connection challenge, the software logic performed accurately. The system successfully maintained a stable "Dead Zone" with a maximum deviation of only **±0.8°C** during test runs.

## Future Improvements

* **Sensor Precision:** Replacing the DHT-11 with a higher accuracy sensor to reduce the current ±2°C tolerance for medical applications.
* **Industrial Wiring:** Designing a custom PCB to eliminate jumper wire risks and improve aesthetic organization.
* **Connectivity Indicators:** Adding a local LED or OLED indicator specifically for Wi-Fi signal status.

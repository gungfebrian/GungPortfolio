# Reimagining the Mundane

Everyday objects shouldn't be boring. **Monsta Can** is my answer to the question: *"Can we make cleaning fun?"*

I engineered this device to transform a simple utility into an engaging IoT experience. By fusing precise sensor technology with a responsive web interface, Monsta Can doesn't just hold trash—it interacts with you, counts your contributions, and gamifies the act of keeping your environment clean.

## ⚡️ Hardware Specs

Built on the robust ESP32 platform, Monsta Can operates wirelessly and efficiently.

| Component | Specification | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microcontroller** | ESP32 | Wi-Fi Web Server & Logic Core |
| **Actuator** | Servo SG90 | Precision Lid Mechanism |
| **Sensors** | 2x Ultrasonic (HC-SR04) | Proximity & Object Detection |
| **Power** | 3.7v Battery (20A) | High-Current Autonomous Power |
| **Regulation** | 5v Step-Up Module | Voltage Stabilization for Sensors |

## ⚙️ Engineering The Logic

The system relies on a **Dual-Sensor Architecture** to automate the workflow seamlessly.

### 1. Proximity Automation (The Reflex)
The first ultrasonic sensor acts as the robot's "eyes."
* **Detection:** Continuously scans the frontal area for user presence.
* **Action:** When you approach (within defined threshold), the ESP32 triggers the servo to lift the lid instantly. No touch required.

### 2. Gamification Engine (The Scorekeeper)
The second sensor is mounted inside the chassis.
* **Tracking:** It monitors the internal volume. When an object passes through the opening, it registers a "drop."
* **Logic:** The system increments the global counter, turning a chore into a high-score chase.

## 📱 The Interface (UI/UX)

Control should be absolute and accessible. I hosted a dedicated **Web Server** directly on the ESP32, allowing any device on the network to access the dashboard.

* **Live Status:** Instantly view if the lid is `LOCKED` or `OPEN`.
* **Real-Time Analytics:** Track your "Daily Drops" or total trash count with zero latency.
* **Manual Override:** A full control suite allowing you to force-open the lid or reset the counters remotely.

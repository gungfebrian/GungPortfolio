Overview

I believe even everyday objects can be made more engaging through technology. My goal with "Monsta Can" was to transform a simple trashcan into a fun, interactive IoT device that could be monitored and controlled remotely.

Tech Stack & Hardware

Sensors: 2x Ultrasonic Sensors

Microcontroller: ESP32

Actuator: 1x Servo SG90

Power: 1x 20A 3.7v Battery with 5v Step Up

How It Works

Monsta Can uses two ultrasonic sensors to automate its operation:

Proximity Detection: One sensor in front detects movement. When you get close, the servo automatically opens the lid.

Trash Counting: A second sensor inside the can detects when trash is thrown in, incrementing a counter.

User Interface

The web interface (hosted on the ESP32) allows for remote monitoring and control:

Status: Shows if the lid is Open or Closed.

Counter: Displays "Times Opened Today" or total trash count.

Controls: Manual buttons to "Open Lid" or "Reset Count".

# Reimagining the Mundane

Everyday objects should not be boring. **Monsta Can** is my solution to a simple question: "Can we make cleaning fun?"

I engineered this device to transform a basic utility into an engaging IoT experience. By fusing precise sensor technology with a responsive web interface, Monsta Can does more than hold trash, it interacts with the user, tracks contributions, and gamifies environmental discipline.

## ⚙️ The Logic Engine

The system utilizes a **Dual Sensor Architecture** to automate the workflow without user intervention.

### 1. Proximity Reflex
The first ultrasonic sensor serves as the visual input for the system.
* **Detection:** It continuously monitors the frontal area for user presence.
* **Action:** When a user is detected within an exact **20 cm** threshold, the ESP32 triggers the servo to lift the lid instantly.

### 2. Gamification Logic
A second sensor is mounted inside the chassis to track activity.
* **Tracking:** It monitors the internal volume to detect when an object passes the opening.
* **Logic:** The system increments a global counter, turning a routine chore into a high score chase.

## 🛠 Mechanical & Visual Engineering

### High Torque Actuation
For reliable operation, I chose the **TowerPro MG996R** servo. Unlike standard hobby motors, this unit uses **metal gears** to provide the torque necessary for a crisp lid response.

* **Mechanical Linkage:** The servo is mounted on the rear interior wall. It uses a custom linkage rod system to convert circular rotation into a linear vertical push.
* **Motion Profile:** Upon trigger, the servo rotates **90°**, driving the rod upward to pivot the lid smoothly on its hinge.



### Real Time Feedback
The front mounted **4 Digit 7 Segment Display** provides an immediate interface for the user.

* **Live Scoreboard:** Displays the current drop count registered by the internal sensors.
* **System Status:** Provides visual cues for battery levels and network connection status during startup.

## 📱 Network Connectivity & UI

I configured the ESP32 to integrate with the **Home Wi Fi Network**. This allow the dashboard to be accessed from any authorized device via a local IP address.

* **Live Monitoring:** Check if the lid is locked or open from across the room.
* **Data Analytics:** View total trash counts and daily activity with zero latency.
* **Remote Control:** Full manual override capabilities to force open the lid or reset scores via the web dashboard.
